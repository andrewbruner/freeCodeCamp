# Data Visualization with D3

D3, or D3.js, stands for Data Driven Documents. It's a JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations in the browser.

D3 is built to work with common web standards – namely HTML, CSS, and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).

D3 supports many different kinds of input data formats. Then, using its powerful built-in methods, you can transform those data into different charts, graphs, and maps.

In the Data Visualization with D3 courses, you'll learn how to work with data to create different charts, graphs, hover elements, and other ingredients to create dynamic and attractive data visualizations.

## Add Document Elements with D3

D3 has several methods that let you add and change elements in your document.

The `select()` method selects one element from the document. It takes an argument for the name of the element you want and returns an HTML node for the first element in the document that matches the name. Here's an example:

```javascript
const anchor = d3.select('a');
```

The above example finds the first anchor tag on the page and saves an HTML node for it in the variable `anchor`. You can use the selection with other methods. The `d3` part of the example is a reference to the D3 object, which is how you access D3 methods.

Two other useful methods are `append()` and `text()`.

The `append()` method takes an argument for the element you want to add to the document. It appends an HTML node to a selected item, and returns a handle to that node.

The `text()` method either sets the text of the selected node, or gets the current text. To set the value, you pass a string as an argument inside the parentheses of the method.

Here's an example that selects an unordered list, appends a list item, and adds text:

```javascript
d3.select('ul')
  .append('li')
  .text('Very important item');
```

D3 allows you to chain several methods together with periods to perform a number of actions in a row.

---

Use the `select` method to select the `body` tag in the document. Then `append` an `h1` tag to it, and add the text `Learning D3` into the `h1` element.

```html
<body>
  <script>
    // Add your code below this line

    d3.select('body')
      .append('h1')
      .text('Learning D3');

    // Add your code above this line
  </script>
</body>
```

## Select a Group of Elements with D3

D3 also has the `selectAll()` method to select a group of elements. It returns an array of HTML nodes for all the items in the document that match the input string. Here's an example to select all the anchor tags in a document:

```javascript
const anchors = d3.selectAll('a');
```

Like the `select()` method, `selectAll()` supports method chaining, and you can use it with other methods.

---

Select all of the `li` tags in the document, and change their text to the string `list item` by chaining the `.text()` method.

```html
<body>
  <ul>
    <li>Example</li>
    <li>Example</li>
    <li>Example</li>
  </ul>
  <script>
    // Add your code below this line

    d3.selectAll('li')
      .text('list item');

    // Add your code above this line
  </script>
</body>
```

## Work with Data in D3

The D3 library focuses on a data-driven approach. When you have a set of data, you can apply D3 methods to display it on the page. Data comes in many formats, but this challenge uses a simple array of numbers.

The first step is to make D3 aware of the data. The `data()` method is used on a selection of DOM elements to attach the data to those elements. The data set is passed as an argument to the method.

A common workflow pattern is to create a new element in the document for each piece of data in the set. D3 has the `enter()` method for this purpose.

When `enter()` is combined with the `data()` method, it looks at the selected elements from the page and compares them to the number of data items in the set. If there are fewer elements than data items, it creates the missing elements.

Here is an example that selects a `ul` element and creates a new list item based on the number of entries in the array:

```html
<body>
  <ul></ul>
  <script>
    const dataset = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
    d3.select('ul').selectAll('li')
      .data(dataset)
      .enter()
      .append('li')
      .text('New item');
  </script>
</body>
```

It may seem confusing to select elements that don't exist yet. This code is telling D3 to first select the `ul` on the page. Next, select all list items, which returns an empty selection. Then the `data()` method reviews the dataset and runs the following code three times, once for each item in the array. The `enter()` method sees there are no `li` elements on the page, but it needs 3 (one for each piece of data in `dataset`). New `li` elements are appended to the ul and have the text `New item`.

---

Select the `body` node, then select all `h2` elements. Have D3 create and append an `h2` tag for each item in the `dataset` array. The text in the `h2` should say `New Title`. Your code should use the `data()` and `enter()` methods.

```html
<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];

    // Add your code below this line

    d3.select('body').selectAll('h2')
      .data(dataset)
      .enter()
      .append('h2')
      .text('New Title');

    // Add your code above this line
  </script>
</body>
```

## Work with Dynamic Data in D3

The last two challenges cover the basics of displaying data dynamically with D3 using the `data()` and `enter()` methods. These methods take a data set and, together with the `append()` method, create a new DOM element for each entry in the data set.

In the previous challenge, you created a new `h2` element for each item in the `dataset` array, but they all contained the same text, `New Title`. This is because you have not made use of the data that is bound to each of the `h2` elements.

The D3 `text()` method can take a string or a callback function as an argument:

```javascript
selection.text((d) => d)
```

In the example above, the parameter `d` refers to a single entry in the dataset that a selection is bound to.

Using the current example as context, the first `h2` element is bound to 12, the second `h2` element is bound to 31, the third `h2` element is bound to 22, and so on.

---

Change the `text()` method so that each `h2` element displays the corresponding value from the `dataset` array with a single space and the string `USD`. For example, the first heading should be `12 USD`.

```html
<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];

    d3.select('body').selectAll('h2')
      .data(dataset)
      .enter()
      .append('h2')
      // Add your code below this line

      .text((d) => d + ' USD');

      // Add your code above this line
  </script>
</body>
```

## Add Inline Styling to Elements

D3 lets you add inline CSS styles on dynamic elements with the `style()` method.

The `style()` method takes a comma-separated key-value pair as an argument. Here's an example to set the selection's text color to blue:

```javascript
selection.style('color', 'blue');
```

---

Add the `style()` method to the code in the editor to make all the displayed text have a `font-family` of `verdana`.

```html
<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];

    d3.select('body').selectAll('h2')
      .data(dataset)
      .enter()
      .append('h2')
      .text((d) => (d + ' USD'))
      // Add your code below this line

      .style('font-family', 'verdana');

      // Add your code above this line
  </script>
</body>
```

## Change Styles Based on Data

D3 is about visualization and presentation of data. It's likely you'll want to change the styling of elements based on the data. You can use a callback function in the `style()` method to change the styling for different elements.

For example, you may want to color a data point blue if it has a value less than 20, and red otherwise. You can use a callback function in the `style()` method and include the conditional logic. The callback function uses the `d` parameter to represent the data point:

```javascript
selection.style('color', (d) => {

});
```

The `style()` method is not limited to setting the `color` - it can be used with other CSS properties as well.

---

Add the `style()` method to the code in the editor to set the `color` of the `h2` elements conditionally. Write the callback function so if the data value is less than 20, it returns red, otherwise it returns green.

**Note:** You can use if-else logic, or the ternary operator.

```html
<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];

    d3.select('body').selectAll('h2')
      .data(dataset)
      .enter()
      .append('h2')
      .text((d) => (d + ' USD'))
      // Add your code below this line

      .style('color', (d) => d < 20 ? 'red' : 'green');

      // Add your code above this line
  </script>
</body>
```

## Add Classes with D3

Using a lot of inline styles on HTML elements gets hard to manage, even for smaller apps. It's easier to add a class to elements and style that class one time using CSS rules. D3 has the `attr()` method to add any HTML attribute to an element, including a class name.

The `attr()` method works the same way that `style()` does. It takes comma-separated values, and can use a callback function. Here's an example to add a class of `container` to a selection:

```javascript
selection.attr('class', 'container');
```

Note that the `class` parameter will remain the same whenever you need to add a class and only the `container` parameter will change.

---

Add the `attr()` method to the code in the editor and put a class of `bar` on the `div` elements.

```html
<style>
  .bar {
    width: 25px;
    height: 100px;
    display: inline-block;
    background-color: blue;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];

    d3.select('body').selectAll('div')
      .data(dataset)
      .enter()
      .append('div')
      // Add your code below this line

      .attr('class', 'bar');

      // Add your code above this line
  </script>
</body>
```

## Update the Height of an Element Dynamically

The previous challenges covered how to display data from an array and how to add CSS classes. You can combine these lessons to create a simple bar chart. There are two steps to this:

1. Create a `div` for each data point in the array

2. Give each `div` a dynamic height, using a callback function in the `style()` method that sets height equal to the data value

Recall the format to set a style using a callback function:

```javascript
selection.style('cssProperty', (d) => d)
```

---

Add the `style()` method to the code in the editor to set the `height` property for each element. Use a callback function to return the value of the data point with the string `px` added to it.

```html
<style>
  .bar {
    width: 25px;
    height: 100px;
    display: inline-block;
    background-color: blue;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];

    d3.select('body').selectAll('div')
      .data(dataset)
      .enter()
      .append('div')
      .attr('class', 'bar')
      // Add your code below this line

      .style('height', (d) => d + 'px');

      // Add your code above this line
  </script>
</body>
```

## Change the Presentation of a Bar Chart

The last challenge created a bar chart, but there are a couple of formatting changes that could improve it:

1. Add space between each bar to visually separate them, which is done by adding a margin to the CSS for the `bar` class

2. Increase the height of the bars to better show the difference in values, which is done by multiplying the value by a number to scale the height

---

First, add a `margin` of `2px` to the `bar` class in the `style` tag. Next, change the callback function in the `style()` method so it returns a value `10` times the original data value (plus the `px`).

**Note:** Multiplying each data point by the *same* constant only alters the scale. It's like zooming in, and it doesn't change the meaning of the underlying data.

```html
<style>
  .bar {
    width: 25px;
    height: 100px;
    /* Add your code below this line */

    margin: 2px;
    
    /* Add your code above this line */
    display: inline-block;
    background-color: blue;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];

    d3.select('body').selectAll('div')
      .data(dataset)
      .enter()
      .append('div')
      .attr('class', 'bar')
      .style('height', (d) => (d * 10 + 'px')) // Change this line
  </script>
</body>
```

## Learn About SVG in D3

SVG stands for *Scalable Vector Graphics*.

Here "scalable" means that, if you zoom in or out on an object, it would not appear pixelated. It scales with the display system, whether it's on a small mobile screen or a large TV monitor.

SVG is used to make common geometric shapes. Since D3 maps data into a visual representation, it uses SVG to create the shapes for the visualization. SVG shapes for a web page must go within an HTML `svg` tag.

CSS can be scalable when styles use relative units (such as `vh`, `vw`, or percentages), but using SVG is more flexible to build data visualizations.

---

Add an `svg` node to the `body` using `append()`. Give it a `width` attribute set to the provided `w` constant and a `height` attribute set to the provided `h` constant using the `attr()` or `style()` methods for each. You'll see it in the output because there's a `background-color` of pink applied to it in the `style` tag.

**Note:** When using `attr()` width and height attributes do not have units. This is the building block of scaling - the element will always have a 5:1 width to height ratio, no matter what the zoom level is.

```html
<style>
  svg {
    background-color: pink;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];

    const w = 500;
    const h = 100;

    const svg = d3.select('body')
                  // Add your code below this line

                  .append('svg')
                  .attr('width', w)
                  .attr('height', h);

                  // Add your code above this line
  </script>
</body>
```

## Display Shapes with SVG

The last challenge created an `svg` element with a given width and height, which was visible because it had a `background-color` applied to it in the `style` tag. The code made space for the given width and height.

The next step is to create a shape to put in the `svg` area. There are a number of supported shapes in SVG, such as rectangles and circles. They are used to display data. For example, a rectangle (`<rect>`) SVG shape could create a bar in a bar chart.

When you place a shape into the `svg` area, you can specify where it goes with `x` and `y` coordinates. The origin point of (0, 0) is in the upper-left corner. Positive values for `x` push the shape to the right, and positive values for `y` push the shape down from the origin point.

To place a shape in the middle of the 500 (width) x 100 (height) `svg` from last challenge, the `x` coordinate would be 250 and the `y` coordinate would be 50.

An SVG `rect` has four attributes. There are the `x` and `y` coordinates for where it is placed in the `svg` area. It also has a `height` and `width` to specify the size.

---

Add a `rect` shape to the `svg` using `append()`, and give it a `width` attribute of `25` and `height` attribute of `100`. Also, give the `rect` `x` and `y` attributes each set to `0`.

```html
<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];

    const w = 500;
    const h = 100;

    const svg = d3.select('body')
                  .append('svg')
                  .attr('width', w)
                  .attr('height', h)
                  // Add your code below this line

                  .append('rect')
                  .attr('width', 25)
                  .attr('height', 100)
                  .attr('x', 0)
                  .attr('y', 0);

                  // Add your code above this line
  </script>
</body>
```
