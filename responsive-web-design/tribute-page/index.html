      <h2>The Legend of Kaldi</h2>
      
      <p>Kaldi was an Ethiopian goatherd around the year 850 CE. One day, while tending his herd of goats, they began to jump and dance strangely. Kaldi became concerned as he found they had been eating red berries off an unknown bush. He feared they may have become sick or possessed.</p>
      <p>After a worrisome night, Kaldi found that his goats had survived their strange spell and, returning to the same mysterious bush, he decided to try a berry for himself.</p>
      <p>After eating a few more, Kaldi began to feel happier, more energetic, and danced along with his goats. Together, Kaldi and his dancing goats had unknowingly been eating coffee cherries and hence discovered the coffee bean!</p>
      <p>...or so the story goes.</p>
