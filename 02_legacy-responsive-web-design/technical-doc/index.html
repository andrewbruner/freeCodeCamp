      <header><code>Growing</code></header>
      <p>There are three primary coffee-growing regions, each with a distinct landscape, climate and flavor profile for
        the coffees that are grown and processed there.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Latin America</li>
        <p>Crisp acidity with flavors of nuts, cocoa and soft spice.</p>
        <li>Africa</li>
        <p>Lush and juicy, with flavors of floral and citrus to berry and spice.</p>
        <li>Asia / Pacific</li>
        <p>Full-bodied and syrupy smooth with herbal,earthy flavors.</p>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="processing">
      <header><code>Processing</code></header>
      <p>Processing is the term used to describe how the beans (seeds) are removed from the coffee cherry. Processing
        plays a part in overall flavor, acidity and body.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Washed Processing</li>
        <p>light, clean and tangy</p>
        <p>Coffee pulp is mechanically removed, leaving a sticky layer called mucilage on the bean. Beans are washed and
          then held in a concrete fermentation tank for 18–36 hours to develop flavor, acidity and body. One final
          washing, and the beans are dried, parchment is removed and the green beans are sorted and graded.</p>

        <li>Semi-washed Processing</li>
        <p>lower acidity, light-bodied and smooth</p>
        <p>Coffee pulp is removed using small handpulping machines, and then the coffee is washed and laid out to dry in
          the sun. After partial drying, parchment is removed and the coffee is laid out again for final drying,
          followed by sorting and grading.</p>

        <li>Natural Processing</li>
        <p>wild, unpredictable and berry</p>
        <p>Coffee cherries are allowed to dry completely on the bean, letting the bean develop flavors before the skin
          and parchment are removed, followed by sorting and grading.</p>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="roasting">
      <header><code>Roasting</code></header>
      <ul>
        <li>Light Roast</li>
        <p>Light-roasted coffees have a shorter roast time, lighter body and mellow flavors.</p>
        <li>Medium Roast</li>
        <p>Medium-roasted coffees are balanced with smooth and rich flavors.</p>
        <li>Dark Roast</li>
        <p>Dark-roasted coffees feature a fuller body and robust, bold flavors.</p>

      <p>Four Fundamentals of Brewing Coffee</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Proportion</li>
        <p>We recommend 2 Tbsp (10 g) ground coffee for every 6 fl oz (180 ml) of water for proper extraction.</p>
        <li>Grind</li>
        <p>Grind determines how long the water and coffee are in contact, and how much flavor is extracted. Proper grind
          delivers only the coffee’s best flavors.</p>
        <li>Water</li>
        <p>Coffee is 98 percent water, so fresh, goodtasting water is essential. If your local tap water tastes good,
          it’s likely to make a good cup of coffee. Otherwise use filtered or bottled water.</p>
        <li>Freshness</li>
        <p>Think of coffee as fresh produce. The enemies of coffee are oxygen, light, heat and moisture. Store opened
          coffee in an opaque, airtight container at room temperature, and use within a week of opening.</p>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="tasting">
      <header><code>Tasting</code></header>
      <p>Whenever you taste coffees, compare and contrast them by identifying the four tasting characteristics for each:
        aroma, acidity, body and flavor.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Aroma</li>
        <p>The way the coffee smells—it could be earthy, spicy, floral, nutty or others. These distinctive aromas are
          directly related to the coffee’s flavor.</p>
        <li>Acidity</li>
        <p>This is a tangy quality or tartness, not the pH level of the coffee. You can feel acidity on the sides and
          tip of your tongue, and sometimes the back of your jawbone, the way you do when you taste citrus fruits or
          drinks. Coffees with high acidity are described as bright, tangy and crisp with a clean finish. Low-acidity
          coffees feel smooth in your mouth and linger.</p>
        <li>Body</li>
        <p>The weight of the coffee on your tongue. Does it feel light or full in your mouth? Like comparing whole milk
          with nonfat milk. Light-bodied coffees feel light and don’t linger; you feel the weight of full-bodied coffees
          on your tongue and the flavor lingers.</p>
        <li>Flavor</li>
        <p>The way the coffee tastes. This characteristic is registered in different parts of the mouth. Citrus, cocoa
          and berries are a just a few flavors you might taste. Some are obvious, and others are subtle.</p>
